### Possible Worlds

1. not subject to "far away country" paradoxes, or Pierre-isms

<blockquote>
<p>
  I will say something briefly about ‘possible worlds’. ... In the present
  monograph I argued against those misuses of the concept that regard possible
  worlds as something like distant planets, like our own surroundings but
  somehow existing in a different dimension, or that lead to spurious problems
  of ‘transworld identification’. Further, if one wishes to avoid the Weltangst
  and philosophical confusions that many philosophers have associated with
  the ‘worlds’ terminology, I recommended that ‘possible state (or history)
  of the world’, or ‘counterfactual situation’ might be better. One should even
  remind oneself that the ‘worlds’ terminology can often be replaced by modal
  talk—‘It is possible that ...’
</p>
</blockquote>

### Rigid Designators

Kripke talks "addresses" in causal chains (blockchains?):

<blockquote>
<p>
  Someone, let’s say, a baby, is born; his parents call him by a certain name.
  They talk about him to their friends, Other people meet him. Through various
  sorts of talk the name is spread from link to link as if by a chain. A speaker
  who is on the far end of this chain, who has heard about, say Richard Feynman,
  in the market place or elsewhere, may be referring to Richard Feynman even
  though he can’t remember from whom he first heard of Feynman or from whom he
  ever heard of Feynman.

## Modal Solvency Theorems

Interesting ontics:

1. _same solvency proof_ in every possible world `◻` (necessitation)
2. _different solvency proofs_ in different possible worlds `◇` (eventual
   consistency)

### Argument Schema

    1. It is possible that p.
    2. Necessarily, if it is possible that the global ledger, G, exists,
       then it is necessary that G exists.
    3. Necessarily, if G exists, then it is not the case that p.
    4. Therefore, it is not possible that G exists. [1–3]

By the formalism:

    1. ◇[p]
    2. G(x) → ◻[G(x)]
    3. ◻[G(x) → ~p]
    4. ¬◇[G(x)]

Consider `pₙ`:

    p₁ = All rights are economically realized.           (S.N.'s "trust" problem has no
                                                          "work").

    p₂ = An autocratic ruler exists.

    p₃ = Some other Force, F, besides G created the law. ("Force" below will be
                                                          defined in terms of
                                                          impulses that
                                                          represent future
                                                          constraints/relationships)

    p₄ = The world's economically free, non-governmental
         agents produce more moral evil than moral
         goodness such that their freedom is not worth
         the cost.

    p₅ = Every economically free, non-governmental agent
         always does the morally wrong thing.

    p₆ = Gratuitous injustice exists.

van Inwagen argues correctly that supposing any counterfactual to an evil is sufficient to
lend sense; whereas preventing a single death within the context of a supposed
evil does not invalidate the meaning of its global effectviz gratuitousness.
Saving one ant after razing an ant bed does not invalidate the evil; they are
two different sorts. Similarly, killing one more ant does not make the evil any
less gratuitous. A gratuitous evil is a sui generis form that is "continuous" as
an epithet of (global) being, and is therefore non-reducible. Genericity,
conversely (e.g., `p₁`) is conceivable. Is the future mathematically an agent of
suffering?

`p₃` is most interesting for our purposes here, which will be described below.
However, it is worth mentioning now that periodic table of information is
strictly modally justified by the reductio ad absurdum. Experimental evidence
remains to be seen, but that also depends on an ontic-optic meta-description.

How is *contingent a priority* useful to cryptography? Saul Kripke's concept
of rigid designation plays out wonderfuly to speak to Brian Cantwell Smith's
damning effect such that computer science lacks a theory. Before we can
establish that its theory is a theory about its own formalism, we should
first discuss the content of that theory, which is its theory of names. A
seemingly plausable story can be set forth how positivists influenced
the objects of scientific discourse to think engender the "clock" and
"reset" metaphors as the base architecture of names. Kripke's system
present three forms of rigid designation that can be tested:

    -------------------------------------------------
    Designator                         R1   R2    R3
    -------------------------------------------------
    'The creator of Python'            No   No    No
    'Linus Torvalds'                   No*  Yes   Yes
    '17'                               Yes  Yes   Yes
    'The politician Clinton'           No   No    Yes
    'The positive square root of 16'   Yes  Yes   Yes

Or more aptly:

    -------------------------------------------------
    Designator                         R1   R2    R3
    -------------------------------------------------
    'The buyer of TRX'                 No   No    No
    'Mindy Milhouse'                   No*  Yes   Yes
    '89hdwia98hd32ql988daa8ahdw8wwdn'  Yes  Yes   Yes

These tables specify the range of problems pertaining to parallel access
requirements of smart contracts. How can modularity breathe new
antinomies into the hashchain protocol graphing problem?

Todd asks

<blockquote>
Can a commitment commit to another commitment?
</blockquote>

This is what I recall thinking of the [Web of Trust](http://xmlns.com/wot/0.1/#term_PubKey),
namely, that one would submit forms containing `@rel`s referring to the
PGP/GPG keys of other users, and however the databases figure in simply
was a manner of Web Applications 1.0 specification by the W3C. If we imagined
the internet as one git repository, it would look like Apache tomcat's
distribution of implementation instances over the actual web now, each
process portraying within a tree structure, yet naturally blocked
by time zones of the world. Can we more efficiently block these
computes, and how does nested committing become an interpretative
grounds for discussing propertization of the hashchain?

Obviously certain solvency proofs can describe future momentum:

Layering protocols is trivial. We can always split and sort, and so on. Most
importantly, these can be *momentum account balances*, arranged by
*momentum paths* within the reference architecture of the distributed
ledger environment. What server is storing the above data? Where, and
where? Why should its potentially *negative balances* influence capital's
committment to validation of transactions and forming blocks that
sustain business accounts? If we employ Yuji Ijiri's methods, we can
employ predictive data to determine intermediate results of
layers of subtotals. Blocks are shaped fundamentally by impulse accounting
layers which describe the relationship of changing momentum within
a [*solvency proof*](https://petertodd.org/2016/commitments-and-single-use-seals#nested-commitments) as argued by Peter Tood. It's important that the proof is encapsulated, but is Openchain sufficient to provide
that encapsulation? Periodic table of information is describing
the modal predicates for distributing names as rigid designators within
the networking architecture. H-Factor makes this plain for the actions,
link relations, etc. that are composed to produce state transitions of
applications, etc. Why should some applications hold solvency proofs, and some
not? Important concepts involve connectivity, but particularly the
requirement of peer collection, and names that might exist, or
have reference:

    the deflationary model      (non-peer addresses     )  (let)    (voice)
    the existence check         (cached peer address    )  (var)    (given-without-givenness)
    designates anything at all  (directed acyclic       )  (const)  (temporality)
                                (graph of budget history)

The third model essentially describes the `given-without-givenness`, such that
we are overloading the meaning of terms in such a way that we create
a statistical timeless space in which non-rigid designation is
qualitatively indistinguishable from non-purposeful information.
By our common consensus protocol concerning the Inception Order,
we are only concerned with purposeful information. How can we make use of
this factivity which turns on the idea that meaning can be nested
for DAGs of momentum accounts? Can a DAG represent future momentum?
How does liveness contribute to the interpretation of identity statements?

## Formal Input Specification Language

We construct analogical extensions by TLA+ in the following ways.

One simple thing we are saying here is that there are four kinds of
layers essential to the backbone of the discovery layer, and
these layers factors are non-coincidental symmetrical thirds.

      3             4
     2 2    ◻-◻    444  -◻◇      1. Negative Introspection (continuous   : ◻¬◻)
    1   1         55555          2. Convergent             (generic      : ◇◻)
                 6666666         3. Brouwerian             (dialectical  : ¬◻◇)
                  55555          4. Positive Introspection (differential : ◻◻)
             ◻◻    444  ◇◻
                    4

Momentum paths would be stored efficiently and formally along these lines. If
"modal logic is the study of modal propositions and the logical relationships
that they bear to one another" then we want to describe changes in those
relations as solvency proofs contribute to modal propositions, particularly
over time. The temporality component contributes to the mechanism
of anchoring media in accord with triple-entry pathing macros. However,
we replace

    it is possible that       ◇
    it is necessary that*     ◻

operator interpretations of the domain of discourse with

    eventually trust                   (solvency proof epistememicity)                ◇
    always trust                       (solvency proof safety; worst case)            ◻

Like so:

    <proof/Alice controls 1337 BTC as of Nov 22nd 2016>

says

    eventually trust proof Alice controls 1337 BTC as of Nov 22nd 2016

Or:

    [proof/Alice controls 1337 BTC as of Nov 22nd 2016]

says

    always trust that Alice controls 1337 BTC as of Nov 22nd 2016

Some nodes will contain ledgers that state, more simply (without `◻` or `◇`):

By periodic table of information's common consensus protocols, we add two more:

### Formal Input Specification for Momentum

                                        P2P-based, so support for LN (link
                                        support) that commit to other

                                        could always commit to another commitment)

One corollary here is that non-idempotency in ontologicals lends to natural
kinds; i.e., that `/my-keywords` yields the JSON response `application/json` in
H-Factor specification that it does is a "natural kind" like "god has the atomic
number 79" or "water = H2O".

    Gold has the atomic number 79

Analogue to cyberspace:

    /my-keywords has the JSON response {"collection": {"version": ... }}

for all SP, solvency proofs. So the Attribution Layer encodes the incomparable
pairs of causal chains of names such that momentum accounts are formally
specified inputs.

## Goals to address Winograd Schemas

We are essentially proposing a semantics behind earlier-later rigid designation
with `timegate`s, like in HTTP Framework for Time-Based Access to Resource
States -- Memento[0] pattern, but to include future states, as momentum paths.

So the Attribution Layer's attributive designations emulate `Memento`+`Futures`
(i.e., `timemap`, `timegate`, `from`, `until`, `to`) to sustain:

    Any evental mode is a set of incomparable computational decisions.

By temporalizing relationships of account paths via `timegates` as the engine of
application state TATEOAS. We observe the accounting relationship in the
following equation:

    Equity    =   Assets      -     Liabilities

Abstracted, we get:

    Present   =   Past

Extended, we get:

    Past      =   Present     =     Future
    [assets]                        [negatives]
    [liabilities]                   [positives]
    [equities]

Ijiri's predictive formula, applied:

    Capital   =   Wealth      =     Budget
                  [incomes]
                  [expenses]

Modeled to free markets of busess transactions, we get:

    Wealth    =   Momentum    =     Force
    [balances]    [profits]         [impulses]
                  [losses]          [actions]

Explained:

1. Wealth - `[balance sheet statement]` first dimension or composition of
   wealth, as assets, liabilities and owner's equity.
2. Momentum - `[momentum, profit, loss statements]` second dimension or change
   of magnitude of wealth, with items to be classified as income and expense
   accounts.
3. Force - `[force, impulse, action statements]` third dimension or capacity to
   acquire new reality in the future (monotonic impulses)

The relationship exists by the formalism, which we've shown such that it is not
our hash function's (instrumentality does not corrupt the predictive data)
collision which analogizes to collapse of the wave function, but rather our
consciousness/brains which causes collapse. So _a relationship_ between future
and current accounts must show a microeconomic mass that has a certain velocity or
momentum to create new wealth.

Other _econometric_ traits (LN) (as opposed to _sememetric_, implied as control
layer (H-Factor), modeled from Rhetorical Relations; in similar fashion "past"
as "meaning is use" in language (facan de parler: LN, LT, CL, most notably,
within the "lingua franca" of the web). So, our control optics pertaining to
control data of links). Therefore, _forms and links are the locus of instrumentality_:

We have extended Memento, essentially, and applied to the periodic table of
information's Attribute Layer as a point of interest in terms of potential
reference implementations. *Meta-link* would therefore be the activity
undertaken to understand the goal of PTI. Other shapes may take form within a
system of communicative praxis of digitality, and all its in-structural demands,
namely the tendential fall of its rate.

Some operator and content combo; e.g.: &, ~, >, etc. that is well-formed as
CCP shapes, standards, norms, problems, gestures, contours, etc.; mapping TBD.
