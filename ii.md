How is *contingent a priority* useful to cryptography? Saul Kripke's concept
of rigid designation plays out wonderfuly to speak to Brian Cantwell Smith's
damning effect such that computer science lacks a theory. Before we can
establish that its theory is a theory about its own formalism, we should
first discuss the content of that theory, which is its theory of names. A
seemingly plausable story can be set forth how positivists influenced
the objects of scientific discourse to think engender the "clock" and
"reset" metaphors as the base architecture of names. Kripke's system
present three forms of rigid designation that can be tested:

    -------------------------------------------------
    Designator                         R1   R2    R3
    -------------------------------------------------
    'The creator of Python'            No   No    No
    'Linus Torvalds'                   No*  Yes   Yes
    '17'                               Yes  Yes   Yes
    'The politician Clinton'           No   No    Yes
    'The positive square root of 16'   Yes  Yes   Yes

Or more aptly:

    -------------------------------------------------
    Designator                         R1   R2    R3
    -------------------------------------------------
    'The buyer of TRX'                 No   No    No
    'Mindy Milhouse'                   No*  Yes   Yes
    '89hdwia98hd32ql988daa8ahdw8wwdn'  Yes  Yes   Yes

These tables specify the range of problems pertaining to parallel access
requirements of smart contracts. How can modularity breathe new
antinomies into the hashchain protocol graphing problem?

Todd asks

<blockquote>
Can a commitment commit to another commitment?

This is what I recall thinking of the [Web of Trust](http://xmlns.com/wot/0.1/#term_PubKey),
namely, that one would submit forms containing `@rel`s referring to the
PGP/GPG keys of other users, and however the databases figure in simply
was a manner of Web Applications 1.0 specification by the W3C. If we imagined
the internet as one git repository, it would look like Apache tomcat's
distribution of implementation instances over the actual web now, each
process portraying within a tree structure, yet naturally blocked
by time zones of the world. Can we more efficiently block these
computes, and how does nested committing become an interpretative
grounds for discussing propertization of the hashchain?

Obviously certain solvency proofs can describe future momentum:

Layering protocols is trivial. We can always split and sort, and so on. Most
importantly, these can be *momentum account balances*, arranged by
*momentum paths* within the reference architecture of the distributed
ledger environment. What server is storing the above data? Where, and
where? Why should its potentially *negative balances* influence capital's
committment to validation of transactions and forming blocks that
sustain business accounts? If we employ Yuji Ijiri's methods, we can
employ predictive data to determine intermediate results of
layers of subtotals. Blocks are shaped fundamentally by impulse accounting
layers which describe the relationship of changing momentum within
a [*solvency proof*](https://petertodd.org/2016/commitments-and-single-use-seals#nested-commitments) as argued by Peter Tood. It's important that the proof is encapsulated, but is Openchain sufficient to provide
that encapsulation? Periodic table of information is describing
the modal predicates for distributing names as rigid designators within
the networking architecture. H-Factor makes this plain for the actions,
link relations, etc. that are composed to produce state transitions of
applications, etc. Why should some applications hold solvency proofs, and some
not? Important concepts involve connectivity, but particularly the
requirement of peer collection, and names that might exist, or
have reference:

    the deflationary model      (non-peer addresses     )  (let)
    the existence check         (cached peer address    )  (var)
    designates anything at all  (directed acyclic
                                 graph of budget history)  (const)

The third model essentially describes the `given-without-givenness`, such that
we are overloading the meaning of terms in such a way that we create
a statistical timeless space in which non-rigid designation is
qualitatively indistinguishable from non-purposeful information.
By our common consensus protocol concerning the Inception Order,
we are only concerned with purposeful information. How can we make use of
this factivity which turns on the idea that meaning can be nested
for DAGs of momentum accounts? Can a DAG represent future momentum?
How does liveness contribute to the interpretation of identity statements?

One simple thing we are saying here is that there are four kinds of
layers essential to the backbone of the discovery layer, and
these layers factors are non-coincidental symmetrical thirds.

Momentum paths would be stored efficiently and formally along these lines. If
"modal logic is the study of modal propositions and the logical relationships
that they bear to one another" then we want to describe changes in those
relations as solvency proofs contribute to modal propositions, particularly
over time. The temporality component contributes to the mechanism
of anchoring media in accord with triple-entry pathing macros. However,
we replace *it is possible that* and *it is necessary that* interpretations
of the domain of discourse with *eventually trust* and *always trust*,
then inherit extensions from TLA+, such as *trust infinitely often* and
*eventually will always trust*, and by periodic table of information's
common consensus protocols: *eventually could always trust*,
*eventually must always trust*, *eventually require always trust*, all of
SP, some solvency proof.

### Possible Worlds
1. not subject to "far away country" paradoxes, or Pierre-isms

<blockquote>
<p>
  I will say something briefly about ‘possible worlds’. ... In the present
  monograph I argued against those misuses of the concept that regard possible
  worlds as something like distant planets, like our own surroundings but
  somehow existing in a different dimension, or that lead to spurious problems
  of ‘transworld identification’. Further, if one wishes to avoid the Weltangst
  and philosophical confusions that many philosophers have associated with
  the ‘worlds’ terminology, I recommended that ‘possible state (or history)
  of the world’, or ‘counterfactual situation’ might be better. One should even
  remind oneself that the ‘worlds’ terminology can often be replaced by modal
  talk—‘It is possible that ...’

### Rigid Designators

Kripke talks "addresses" in causal chains (blockchains?):

<blockquote>
<p>
  Someone, let’s say, a baby, is born; his parents call him by a certain name.
  They talk about him to their friends, Other people meet him. Through various
  sorts of talk the name is spread from link to link as if by a chain. A speaker
  who is on the far end of this chain, who has heard about, say Richard Feynman,
  in the market place or elsewhere, may be referring to Richard Feynman even
  though he can’t remember from whom he first heard of Feynman or from whom he
  ever heard of Feynman.
